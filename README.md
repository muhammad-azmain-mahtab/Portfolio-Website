## Key Features
### 1. Scroll Animations
- Instead of using the popular AOS (Animate On Scroll) library I used the **Intersection Observer API** ([Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)) for animations.

- For multiple items in the animations the **nth-child()** ([Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child)) pseudo selector for adding incremental delay for each items for smoother animation.
